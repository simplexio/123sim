/**
 * The listener interface should be implemented by the clients of
 * {@link OHAPInterface}.
 * <p>
 * The listener will be notified using the callback methods of interesting
 * events within the protocol.
 * <p>
 * NOTE!: The protocol runs in a separate thread from the client. As protocol
 * calls these callbacks, the call is made in the protocol thread context. Thus,
 * if you do any UI related stuff in the callbacks, you have to implement it so
 * that the code is run in the main thread context of the application, not in
 * the protocol thread context. Example client implementation in the
 * HomeControlService class:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 *  public void errorMessageFromServer(final String msg) {
 * 	eventHandler.post(new Runnable() { // eventHandler is a Handler you need to instantiate as class member.
 * 		public void run() {
 * 			Log.d(TAG, "Model got error msg from server: " + msg);
 * 			String str = getString(R.string.server_said_error);
 * 			Toast.makeText(HomeControlService.this, str + msg, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
 * 		}
 * 	});
 * }
 *  </code>
 * </pre>
