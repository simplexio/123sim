/**
 * AbstractDevice holds all the common properties of different devices 
 * in the home control application. It is used as an abstract class
 * in containers and in handling all generic functionality for it's
 * subclasses.<p>
 * 
 * AbstractDevice implements the Comparable interface so that we can
 * sort the devices when shown in a list view. The class also supports
 * the Visitor design pattern by implementing the accept method. It also
 * acts as the abstract base class for the Composite design pattern, and
 * declares the abstract child handling methods for the Composite.<p>
 * 
 * The member variables for the device(s) are null by default. This enables
 * us to handle those properties of the device we didn't get information
 * about from the server. This is because sometimes server can send only
 * some set of data about a device, not all of it. Since there are no
 * reasonable "not set" values for many properties, null is used instead.<p>
