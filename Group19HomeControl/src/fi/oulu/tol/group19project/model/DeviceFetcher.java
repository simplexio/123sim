/**
 * DeviceFetcher is a {@link Visitor} which goes through a device object
 * structure and finds a specified device, returning it to the caller.<p>
 * 
 * It is possible to fetch a device by it's index in the device structure
 * or by device id, currently.<p>
 * 
 * The method for getting the n'th device goes through the whole hierarchy
 * of devices depth first and returns the child device from the hierarchy.<p>
 * 
 * You can use this fetcher to get the n'th device in the DeviceAdapter,
 * to provide the device object to show in a specific row in the list view.<p>
 * 
 * Usage example:
 * <pre><code>
 * DeviceContainer devices = new DeviceContainer();
 * ...
 * DeviceFetcher fetcher = new DeviceFetcher();
 * ...
 * // Get the 10th device from devices: 
 * AbstractDevice d = fetcher.fetchChildDevice(devices, 10);
 * ...
 * // Get the device with with id "my-device-id" from devices:
 * d = fetcher.fetchChildDevice(devices, "my-device-id");
 * </code></pre>
